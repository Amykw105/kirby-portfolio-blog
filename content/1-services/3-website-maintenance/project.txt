Websites will not perform for your business if it's not updated regularly. This obviously takes time and if you're running a business, your website is unlikely to be your top priority. That's where I can help. 

An up to date website will not only increase your search engine ratings but also give a better impression to your customers - they'll let you know if it's out of date and that will give them a poor impression of your business. Incorrect opening times and contact details can not only be frustrating for your customers but may also prevent them from becoming paying customers - if they can't contact you, how will they buy from you?

## What I'll do

1. (link: /services/website-audit text: Assess your existing website) and gather your update requirements
2. Take a full backup of your website
3. Integrate the new updated into your site and publish any new content
4. Launch your new website changes
